Dataset:

https://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca/research/The_McGill_Billboard_Project_(Chord_Analysis_Dataset)/

File should be billboard-2.0-salami_chords.[extension], each folder contains a text file with the chord progession of each song.

The idea is that we form a markov chain which can identify the probability distribution of any given note for the notes that should follow. In this way, the code can generate a song via an array of chords/notes which can then be turned into a song following a consistent tempo/time signature. 

FORMATTING NOTES TAKEN FROM THE SITE:

Capital letters, possibly followed by an arbitrary number of primes (apostrophes), designate high-level musical structures. They appear at the beginning of each high-level musical segment and are presumed to continue until the next appearance of a capital letter. When two letters match, the two high-level segments are musically similar. Other than denoting similarity, the letters themselves have no intrinsic meaning, but for the letter Z. Z denotes non-musical passages in the audio such as noise or spoken words.

Plain text strings denote more traditional names for musical structures, e.g., verse, chorus, and bridge. The vocabulary was semi-restricted, but annotators had the freedom to use whatever terms they felt were most appropriate for unusual contexts.

Chord annotations appear as series of bars flanked by pipes (|). A phrase may by followed by an x and an integer, which means that the phrase is repeated that number of times. A phrase may also be followed by an arrow (->), which is a musicological hint that the phrase is musically elided into the following phrase.

Leading instruments are noted in songs where there is a notable deviation from the norm of a leading vocal throughout the entire song. They appear as text strings preceded by a left parenthesis (() in the segment where the instrument comes to prominence and as text strings succeeded by a right parenthesis ()) in the segment where that instrument fades from prominence. If an instrument is prominent for a single segment only, its name appears with both left and right parentheses.

Pros:
- Large dataset, easily accessible
- Clear to the human eye, able to be understood by a human easily based on formatting
- Easy to use for computational parsing due to text format
- Small filesize

Cons:
- Some differences in formatting between files, weird nuanced occurances such as that of "N" or the presence of 2 chords within a single bar. Can cause complications in parsing.
	-> As a result of difficulty parsing, manual parsing may be needed. In this case, if the 	data fails to work in the given context it could be very frustrating (not to mention a 		waste of time)
- No genre tagging
- Mixed time signatures
- Music theory/notation needs to be learned in order to better understand how to create a parser, since the formatting of chords seems to be created for people with a firm grasp on music to understand.
